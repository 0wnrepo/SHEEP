# SHEEP
SHEEP is a Homomorphic Encryption Evaluation Platform.
Homomorphic Encryption allows mathematical operations
to be performed on encrypted data, such that the result when
decrypted is what would have been obtained from addition or
multiplication of the plaintexts. The goal of the project is to
provide an accessible platform for testing the features and
performance of the available Homomorphic Encryption libraries.
